Update Text Layer Name
======================

Sketch plugin to update Text layer names from their own text values. Simple as that.

### Install
Copy `Update Text Layer Name.sketchplugin` folder to Sketch plugins folder. 

#### How to Use
Just select any number of item(s) and run the plugin. It goes through all of selected items and renames Text items based their own actual text string value. You can choose any number of groups and/or layers and it'll pick only Text items.

1. Select layers and/or groups that contains Text elements.
2. Use shortcut `ctrl` + `alt` + `cmd` + `T` or use `Plugins` menu.
3. Now you text layer names should match with the actual text values.

#### Shortcuts
* Update Text Layer Name `ctrl` + `alt` + `cmd` + `T`

### About
I started to get bored to update "Text item layer names" manually. I just want to get their name to match actual text string.
